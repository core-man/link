This site collects a lot of useful sites I found during my daily life and researches. I also refer to [seisman’s links](https://link.seisman.info/), and report my links to seisman. Most of seisman’s and my links are now the same, but the organizations are a little different.

The links are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/core-man/link).
