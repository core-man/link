I have been cooperated with [seisman](https://github.com/seisman) to maintain [SeisLinks](https://link.seisman.info/) since Oct. 2020. All the links in the website are currently being merged to [SeisLinks](https://link.seisman.info/), while the left are planned to put on a personal wiki website.

This site collects a lot of useful sites I found during my daily life and researches. I also refer to [SeisMan’s links](https://link.seisman.info/), and report my links to SeisMan. Most of SeisMan’s and my links are now the same, but the organizations are a little different.

The links are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/core-man/link).
