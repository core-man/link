I have been cooperated with [seisman](https://github.com/seisman) to maintain [Seismo Links](https://github.com/seismo-learn/links) since Oct. 2020.
Most links in the website have been merged to [Seismo Links](https://github.com/seismo-learn/links), while the left will not been maintained any more.

This site collects a lot of useful sites I found during my daily life and researches.
The links are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/core-man/link).
